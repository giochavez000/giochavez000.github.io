        <h1> About Me </h1>
       <p id="intro"> <img id="me" src="meee.jpg"> Hello! My name is Gio Chavez and I'm a freshmen art major at <a target="_Blank" href= "https://www.uri.edu/">URI </a>. 
            Additionally, I am a proud Mexican-American. The image of myself included in the banner above is actually a self portrait I drew.
            In the graphite drawing, I am eating a pomegranate in a strange pose. Oddly enough, pomegranates are a symbol that often appear in my art work.
           <br> <img id="emb" src="emb.jpg"> My interest are drawing, embroidery, crochet, and I am learning to
           roller skate. Although I am still not very good at embroidery, I still enjoy it a lot because it reminds me of my family.
           A fun fact is that I am a saggitarius and my chinese zodiac is the horse.
           <br><img id="peluchin" src="peluchin.jpg"> I also have a pet dog. His name is Peluchin and he is a toy poodle. 
           This year he will be turning 18! One of his favorite snacks is little pieces of tortilla.
