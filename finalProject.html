            <br> <h1> Gio's Final CSC106 Project </h1>
            <br> Below is mine and my partner's, David Quevedo's, Final project for CSC106. Our final project was an Alien Platformer game. In this game the player plays as Loco, an alien, who is looking for his keys. While he is out looking for his keys, his angry neighbors are trying to attack him! The player must jump on roof tops and avoid the neighbors till his keys are found. The player has the ability to jump, move forward, and move backwards. The player can also collect gem-like fruit to regain health.
